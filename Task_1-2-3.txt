What’s your proudest achievement? It can be a personal project or something you’ve worked on professionally.
Just a short paragraph is fine, but I’d love to know why you’re proud of it.

I worked for Chologhuri Limited as a software developer, where I developed an online travel booking web application 
and a Content Management System (CMS) for the web application. During my work period, Chologhuri Limited was a 
fast-growing start-up in Bangladesh, and I looked after all of their technical projects. Nowadays, Chologhuri Limited 
is one of the leading online travel agencies that has served more than 1000 clients. I feel proud of myself when I see 
that the company achieved so many things with the software I developed.

Tell me about a technical book or article you read recently, why you liked it, and why I should read it.

Recently I read the following article: "When Coding Style Survives Compilation: De-anonymizing Programmers from Executable
Binaries (https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.08546)". The article was published in the Network and Distributed Systems Security (NDSS)
Symposium 2018. The article is about de-anonymizing programmers from a set of programs written by a group of programmers. It's
interesting how the coding style of different programmers can be characterized and quantified. I found the topic more attractive
than their solving approaches. It will help if you read the article because it would give you an idea of detecting anonymous
malicious coders from their written codes.

Tell me about one feature of zeckoShop you really like, and why.

I liked the idea of modular features in zeckoShop. Although most of the e-commerce businesses' basic principles are the same,
companies may need different features depending on their products. The modular features in zeckoShop make it easy for clients
to choose what they need. Also, it allows developers to improve and upgrade more features easily.
